This is a repository for studying clean arch in node, using DDD to model the domain even though it is a very basic domain. 
TDD was also applied to try to cover the entire project with tests.

As for me, who designed the project, 
I could see that the controllers and presenters lacked greater care, especially when it comes to presenting errors to the user 
and also when using the supertest testing tool with the routes.

Any suggested changes, I will humbly accept, as every suggestion is welcome to me.

Any pull request will be reviewed.
